spring boot war file with explicit web or app server..


to achieve this

1) added spring-boot-starter-tomcat dependency with provided scope, it means asking boot to skip embedded tomcat server
2) main method not recognize by other servers to achieve this, we have to extends SpringbootApplication class from SpringBootServletInitilizer
and implement configure method and pass SpringbootApplication.class as input 
3) change jar to war in pom.xml
